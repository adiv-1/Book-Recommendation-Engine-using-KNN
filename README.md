# Book-Recommendation-Engine-using-KNN

### Built a book recommendation system using K-Nearest Neighbors and the Book-Crossings dataset

This project was part of the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning curriculum, where I developed a book recommendation engine using K-Nearest Neighbors. I utilized the Book-Crossings dataset, which contains 1.1 million ratings of 270,000 books by 90,000 users. The process involved importing and cleaning the data, and then using the NearestNeighbors algorithm from sklearn to identify and recommend books similar to a given title. The engine returns a list of five books along with their similarity scores.
